## Testing 

### Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera browsers.

Steps to test:

1. Open browser and navigate to [BettleJuice]( https/)
2. Open the developer tools (right click and inspect)
3. Set to responsive and decrease width to 320px
4. Set the zoom to 50%
5. Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width

Expected:

Website is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched.
No horizontal scroll is present.
No elements overlap.

Actual:

Website behaved as expected with the exception of switching to landscape . 

Website was also opened on the following devices and no responsive issues were seen:

- Oukitel C21 Pro
- TCL 30 Pro
- iPhone SE
- Samsung Galaxy Tablet

### Accessibility

[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs
- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed

Manual tests were also performed to ensure the website was accessible as possible and an accessibility issue was identified.

Issue : After keyboard controls were implemented, while testing the site with windows 'Narrator' screenreader, it was not clearly known what the purpose of the labels/checkboxes were. An aria-label label was added to the labels for screen readers to alert them that the labels were clickable and what their purpose was. Note:  I was only able to perform thise text of th e time factor.

## Deployment

### Version Control

The site was designed and created by a team of 6, using the Visual Studio code editor and pulled and pushed to Git Hub to the remote repository ‚ÄòBeetlejuice‚Äô.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git pull origin main ``` - This command is used to fetch changes from a remote repository and integrate them into your current local branch..

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m ‚Äúcommit message‚Äù``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

```git checkout ``` -  This Git command is used for changing the current branch you're working on.


### Deployment to Github Pages

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the menu on left select 'Pages'
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Branch: main
  - Click 'Save'
  - A live link will be displayed in a green banner when published successfully. 

The live link can be found here -  https://ujuadimora-dev.github.io/FunTime-Quiz/
